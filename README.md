This is a fork of Apache's `guacamole-common-js` to be used as a NPM package.

The `gulp` tasks being used in this repo were borrowed from [padarom's fork](https://github.com/padarom/guacamole-common-js), the difference is that this repo forks directly from the [Apache's repository](https://github.com/apache/guacamole-client).
